## Project Journey

* Started with a style sheet: A consistent visual design was established by creating a custom style sheet that captures the essence of Little Lemon Restaurant.
* Low fidelity wireframe: A basic outline of the user interface and functionality was created using low fidelity wireframes.
* High fidelity mock-up in Figma: Using the wireframes as a guide, a high fidelity mock-up of the webapp was designed in Figma, showcasing the color scheme, typography, and overall layout.

## Webapp development using React: 
Leveraging the power of React, the webapp was developed with a focus on responsiveness, reusability, and maintainability of components.

* Navigation items: Functional navigation items were implemented to enable users to effortlessly navigate through the webapp.
* Client-side validating form: A reservation form with client-side validation was added to ensure data integrity and improve user experience.
* Context for information extraction: Utilized React Context to manage and extract information from the reservation form.
* DOM updates & custom confirmation message: Controlled the update of the DOM and displayed a custom confirmation message after a reservation was made.
